# flux-react-app
a simple app made with react and using flux pattern

For this test i have used the npm library created by facebook for this. Modules were created with browserify and the views are created with react js. I compiled everything with babelify.

I covered everything, but the views, with tests, using jest tool. You can find them under /js/__test__/

    1. go to your local copy of the repository
    2. npm install to instal node dependencies
    3. grunt http-server:dev to init the server. Index will be open in the browser
